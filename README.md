# EvolutionSimulatorAI

Custom Machine Deep Learning library with
  +Gradient descent
  +Back-propagation
  +Fully customization size
  +Visualization
  +Variability out input/output relationship 
  
  It also has the ability to change inputs to optimize outputs or vice versa. 
  
  Requires the full Unity project to operate correctly for evolution simulation. 
  But could be a good basis for someone to create their own AI of any sort from. Good standalone library for future projects. 
  And only one I know of that's in C#.
